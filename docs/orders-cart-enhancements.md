# Orders and Cart Enhancements Summary

This document captures the current state of the recently completed work to enhance orders, cart management, and public product search across the admin and customer experiences.

## Implemented Features

- **Recently Viewed Products** – Backend query improvements now allow the Admin Panel to display the same product history that customers see on the storefront, ensuring consistency across sessions.
- **Order Variant & Coupon Metadata** – Orders persist variant attributes (such as SKU, color, and capacity) alongside coupon details so the Admin Panel surfaces complete purchase context.
- **Orders Module UI Refresh** – The admin orders page adopts the shared tabular layout with filtering, sorting, pagination, and detailed order panels for a uniform management experience.
- **Cart Management Module** – Administrators can browse and manage user carts via a dedicated page that supports creating carts, editing line items, and clearing cart contents.
- **Public Product Search Suggestions** – The storefront header now offers debounced, live product suggestions with thumbnails for faster navigation.

## Follow-up Tasks

- Resolve the Maven Central download (HTTP 403) issue so the backend build can succeed in CI/CD environments.
- Add automated tests covering the new cart administration endpoints and order-search logic.
- Iterate on the cart management UX to streamline product selection and ensure accessibility of the storefront search dropdown across browsers.
